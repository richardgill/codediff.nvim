-- Regression test for https://github.com/esmuellert/codediff.nvim/issues/353
-- "3-way merge fails to include non-conflicting adjacent insertions in Result buffer"
--
-- Before the fix: the Result buffer was seeded with raw BASE content and any
-- one-sided insertion that lived inside the same git hunk as a true conflict
-- silently vanished from the Result.
--
-- After the fix: the Result buffer is seeded with the VSCode-style
-- auto-merged content (BASE + every non-conflicting change from both sides)
-- and only true two-sided conflicts are left as BASE for the user to resolve.
