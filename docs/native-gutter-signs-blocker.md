# Native gutter signs design constraint

Neovim ignores `sign_text` when an extmark has `ephemeral = true`. This is tracked in [neovim/neovim#32936](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/32936) and was reproduced on Neovim 0.11.5 and 0.12.2.

CodeDiff therefore uses ordinary persistent ranged extmarks. A changed hunk, move segment, whole-file sign, or unchanged-line blocker needs only one extmark per contiguous range, so storage does not scale with the number of lines covered.

Persistent signs are buffer-local rather than window-local. If another window shows a buffer participating in an active CodeDiff view, it shows the same CodeDiff signs. Suspending or closing the diff clears them.

Inline deleted rows are virtual lines and cannot carry native signs. CodeDiff renders their delete glyph through a temporary window-local `statuscolumn` in the inline content window, preserving native signs on real rows and restoring the previous value when inline layout ends.

Neovim 0.11 introduced the experimental `nvim__ns_set()` API, which can scope persistent extmark namespaces to windows. CodeDiff does not depend on that private-style API; window-local signs can be reconsidered when Neovim exposes a stable supported mechanism.
